# Foodie App

This project is a practice project for Maximilian Schwarzmüller's Next.js Udemy course.
I am building a Foodie App to apply and reinforce what I have learned in the course while experimenting with Next.js features.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
